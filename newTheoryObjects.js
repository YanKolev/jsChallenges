const owedMoney = {}; //creates empty object
owedMoney ["Jimmy"] = 5; //we assign value of 5 to key jimmy
owedMoney ["Anna"] = 7; // same for anna as for jimmy
// if we call the key jimmy, like: owedMoney ["Jimmy"]; ->the result will be 5
owedMoney ["Jien"] // it will return undeintified because we did not set such key-value pair in the first place.
