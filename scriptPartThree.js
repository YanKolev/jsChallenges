/* Javascript is a high-level prototype-based object-oriented
multi-paradigm interpreted or just-in-time compiled
dynamic single-threaded, garbage-collected programming language
with first-class functions and non-blocking event-loop conncurency mode.
*/

/* Paradigm: An approach and mindset of structuring code, which will direct
your coding style and technique.
-procedural, just organizing the code in liniear way
-OOP- prototype based OOP, 
almost everyting in JS in an object, without some of the primitive types. 

-prototypal inheritance: 

-functional-


-functions are treated as variables (first- class functions)

- Non-blocking event loop:
what is concurency- how JS engine handles tasks at the same time.
JS runs in a single thread, if we need a long-running task(we want non-blocking behaviour- we need event loop- that
takes the running tasks, executes them in the 'background' and puts them back in the main thread once they are finished).
